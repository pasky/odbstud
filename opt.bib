	perturbation stochastic approximation, simulated annealing, evolution
	strategies, and genetic algorithms. We summarize the available theoretical
	results on rates of convergence for the five algorithm forms and
	then use the theoretical results to draw some preliminary conclusions
	on the relative efficiency. Our aim is to sort out some of the competing
	claims of efficiency and to suggest a structure for comparison that
	is more general and transferable than the usual problem-specific
	numerical studies.},

In this application {GP} is used as an online learning method which evolves heuristics while solving the problem. In other words, the system keeps on evolving heuristics for a problem instance until a good solution is found. The framework is tested on some of the most widely used benchmarks in the field of exam timetabling and compared with the best state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that the framework is very competitive with other constructive techniques, and did outperform other hyper-heuristic frameworks on many occasions.},

For continuous variables the use of ML estimates for the normal distribution does not directly lead to successful optimization in most landscapes. It was previously found that an important reason for this is the premature shrinking of the variance at an exponential rate. Remedies were subsequently successfully formulated (i.e. Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) and Standard-Deviation Ratio triggering (SDR)). Here we focus on a second source of inefficiency that is not removed by existing remedies. We then provide a simple, but effective technique called Anticipated Mean Shift (AMS) that removes this inefficiency.},

@book{Dawkins1976SelfishGene,
    abstract = {{Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson,  and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of <I>The Selfish Gene</I>. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that "our" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since.  <P> Why are there miles and miles of "unused" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or <I>memes</I>, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. <i>--Rob Lightner</i> } {Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it.  His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life.  <P>In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature.  Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.  <P>This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters.  One, entitled "Nice Guys Finish First," demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world.  The other new chapter, entitled "The Long Reach of the Gene," which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.}},

@article{deb05PopulationBased,
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a population-based, four-step, real-parameter optimization algorithm-generator. The approach divides the task of reaching near the optimum solution into four independent plans of (i) selecting good solutions from a solution base, (ii) generating new solutions using the selected solutions, (iii) choosing inferior or spurious solutions for replacement, and (iv) updating the solution base with good new or old solutions. Interestingly, many classical and evolutionary optimization algorithms are found to be representable by this algorithm-generator. The paper also recommends an efficient optimization algorithm with the possibility of using a number of different recombination plans and parameter values. With a systematic parametric study, the paper finally recommends a real-parameter optimization algorithm which outperforms a number of existing classical and evolutionary algorithms. To extend this study, the proposed algorithm-generator can be utilized to develop new and more efficient population-based optimization algorithms. The treatment of population-based classical and evolutionary optimization algorithms identically through the proposed algorithm-generator is the main hall-mark of this paper and should enable researchers from both classical and evolutionary fields to understand each otherrsquos methods better and interact in a more coherent manner.},

    abstract = {Adaptive Operator Selection ({AOS}) turns the impacts of the applications of variation operators into Operator Selection through a Credit Assignment mechanism. However, most Credit Assignment schemes make direct use of the fitness gain between parent and offspring. A first issue is that the Operator Selection technique that uses such kind of Credit Assignment is likely to be highly dependent on the a priori unknown bounds of the fitness function. Additionally, these bounds are likely to change along evolution, as fitness gains tend to get smaller as convergence occurs. Furthermore, and maybe more importantly, a fitness-based credit assignment forbid any invariance by monotonous transformation of the fitness, what is a usual source of robustness for comparison-based Evolutionary Algorithms. In this context, this paper proposes two new Credit Assignment mechanisms, one inspired by the Area Under the Curve paradigm, and the other close to the Sum of Ranks. Using fitness improvement as raw reward, and directly coupled to a {Multi-Armed} Bandit Operator Selection Rule, the resulting {AOS} obtain very good performances on both the {OneMax} problem and some artificial scenarios, while demonstrating their robustness with respect to hyper-parameter and fitness transformations. Furthermore, using fitness ranks as raw reward results in a fully comparison-based {AOS} with reasonable performances.},

    abstract = {The family of natural evolution strategies (NES) offers a principled approach to real-valued evolutionary optimization by following the natural gradient of the expected fitness. Like the well-known CMA-ES, the most competitive algorithm in the field, NES comes with important invariance properties. In this paper, we introduce a number of elegant and efficient improvements of the basic NES algorithm. First, we propose to parameterize the positive definite covariance matrix using the exponential map, which allows the covariance matrix to be updated in a vector space. This new technique makes the algorithm completely invariant under linear transformations of the underlying search space, which was previously achieved only in the limit of small step sizes. Second, we compute all updates in the  natural  coordinate system, such that the natural gradient coincides with the vanilla gradient. This way we avoid the computation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, which is the main computational bottleneck of the original NES algorithm. Our new algorithm, exponential NES (xNES), is significantly simpler than its predecessors. We show that the various update rules in CMA-ES are closely related to the natural gradient updates of xNES. However, xNES is more principled than CMA-ES, as all the update rules needed for covariance matrix adaptation are derived from a single principle. We empirically assess the performance of the new algorithm on standard benchmark functions},

We analyze isotropic and anisotropic heavy-tail Cauchy distributions and investigate the probability to sample a better solution, depending on the step length and the dimensionality of the search space. The probability decreases fast with increasing step length for isotropic Cauchy distributions and moderate search space dimension. The anisotropic Cauchy distribution maintains a large probability for sampling large steps along the coordinate axes, resulting in an exceptionally good performance on the separable multimodal Rastrigin function. In contrast, on a non-separable rotated Rastrigin function or for the isotropic Cauchy distribution the performance difference to a Gaussian search distribution is negligible.},

Adaptive Encoding is applicable to any iterative search algorithm and employs incremental changes of the representation of solutions. One attractive way to change the representation in the continuous domain is derived from Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA). In this case, adaptive encoding recovers the CMA evolution strategy, when applied to an evolution strategy with cumulative step-size control. Consequently, adaptive encoding provides the means to apply CMA-like representation changes to any search algorithm in the continuous domain. Experimental results confirm the expectation that CMA-based adaptive encoding will generally speed up a typical evolutionary algorithm on non-separable, ill-conditioned problems by orders of magnitude.},

Similarly, a group of loci are epistatically linked if the effect of changing the allele at one locus depends on the alleles at all other loci of the group. Under the assumption that the size of such groups of loci are bounded, and assuming that the function is given only as a "black box function", this paper presents and analyzes a randomized algorithm that finds the complete epistatic structure of the function in the form of the Walsh coefficients of the function.}},

    abstract = {The Building Block Hypothesis suggests that Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are well-suited for hierarchical problems, where efficient solving requires proper problem decomposition and assembly of solution from sub-solution with strong non-linear interdependencies. The paper proposes a hill-climber operating over the building block (BB) space that can efficiently address hierarchical problems. The new Building Block Hill-Climber (BBHC) uses hill-climb search experience to learn the problem structure. The neighborhood structure is adapted whenever new knowledge about the underlaying BB structure is incorporated into the search. This allows the method to climb the hierarchical structure by revealing and solving consecutively the hierarchical levels.

In existing variants of that algorithm, only information gathered from successful offspring candidate solutions contributes to the adaptation of the covariance matrix, while old information passively decays. We propose to use information about unsuccessful offspring candidate solutions in order to actively reduce variances of the mutation distribution in unpromising directions of the search space.

@article{Krasnogor2005TutorialOnMAs,
    abstract = {The combination of evolutionary algorithms with local search was named "memetic algorithms" ({MAs}) (Moscato, 1989). These methods are inspired by models of natural systems that combine the evolutionary adaptation of a population with individual learning within the lifetimes of its members. Additionally, {MAs} are inspired by Richard Dawkin's concept of a meme, which represents a unit of cultural evolution that can exhibit local refinement (Dawkins, 1976). In the case of {MA}'s, "memes" refer to the strategies (e.g., local refinement, perturbation, or constructive methods, etc.) that are employed to improve individuals. In this paper, we review some works on the application of {MAs} to well-known combinatorial optimization problems, and place them in a framework defined by a general syntactic model. This model provides us with a classification scheme based on a computable index D, which facilitates algorithmic comparisons and suggests areas for future research. Also, by having an abstract model for this class of metaheuristics, it is possible to explore their design space and better understand their behavior from a theoretical standpoint. We illustrate the theoretical and practical relevance of this model and taxonomy for {MAs} in the context of a discussion of important design issues that must be addressed to produce effective and efficient {MAs}.},

The program trees are constructed in a pre-order fashion, which means that as the genome is traversed first the left most branch of the tree is completed then the second from the left one etc. Once two individuals are crossed over by means of simple one-point crossover the tail parts of the chromosomes (originally encoding the structures on the right side of the program tree) may map on different program structures within the new context. Here we present a bidirectional representation which helps to equalize the survival rate of both the program structures appearing on the left and right side of the program parse tree.},

For experimental evaluation 10-input, 12-input, 14-input and 16-input instances of the sorting network problem were used. Results show that the proposed POEMS approach clearly outperforms both compared algorithms. Moreover, POEMS was able to find several perfect networks that are equivalent w.r.t. the number of comparators to the best known solutions for the 10-input, 12-input, 14-input, and 16-input problems.

Recently, an application of the iterative optimization method called Prototype Optimization with Evolved Improvement Steps (POEMS) to the SCS problem has been proposed. The POEMS seeks the best variation of the current solution in each iteration. The variations, considered as structured hypermutations, are evolved by means of an evolutionary algorithm. This approach has been shown to work very well on synthetic as well as real biological data. However, the approach exhibited rather low scalability which is caused by very time demanding evaluation function. This paper proposes a new time efficient evaluation procedure and a new moving-window strategy for constructing and refining the supersequence. These two enhancements significantly improve an efficiency of the approach. Series of experiments with the modified POEMS method have been carried out. Results presented in this paper show that the method is competitive with current state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the SCS problem. Moreover, there is a potential for further improvement as discussed in the conclusions.},

Two versions of this algorithm, {ISEA}-chesc and {ISEA}-adaptive, that differ in the re-initialization scheme are presented. The performance of the two algorithms was experimentally evaluated on six hard optimization problems using the {HyFlex} experimental framework and the algorithms were compared with algorithms that took part in the {CHeSC} 2011 challenge. Achieved results are very promising, the {ISEA}-adaptive would take the second place in the competition. It shows how important for good performance of this iterated local search hyper-heuristic is the re-initialization strategy.},

Like ECGA, the proposed algorithm partitions the problem variables into a set of clusters that are manipulated as independent variables and estimates the population distribution using marginal product models (MPMs); like rBOA, it employs finite mixtures of models and it does not use any sort of discretization. Accordingly, the proposed real-coded EDA can be either viewed as the extension of the ECGA to real-valued domains by means of finite mixture models or as a simplification of the real-coded BOA to the marginal product models (MPMs). The results reported here show that the number of evaluations required by the proposed algorithm scales sub-quadratically with the problem size in additively separable problems.},

Mutual information between real-valued variables is employed to measure variable interaction or dependency, and the variable clustering and aggregation algorithms are proposed to identify the substructures of a problem through partitioning variables. Then, mixture Gaussian probability density function is estimated to model the promising individuals for each substructure, and the sampling of multivariate Gaussian probability density function is carried out by adopting Cholesky decomposition. Facet analyses are made about the population sizing and sampling of the factorization based on the Gaussian probability density function. Finally, experiments on decomposable test functions are conducted. The results illustrate that the rECGA is able to correctly identify the substructure of decomposable problems with linear or nonlinear correlations, and achieves a good scalability.},

Recent approaches automate the tuning and control of the parameters that govern this balance. We propose a new technique to dynamically control the behavior of operators in an {EA} and to manage a large set of potential operators. The best operators are rewarded by applying them more often. Tests of this technique on instances of {3-SAT} return results that are competitive with an algorithm tailored to the problem.},

@article{Montana1995StronglyTypedGP,
    abstract = {Genetic programming is a powerful method for automatically generating computer programs via the process of natural selection (Koza, 1992). However, in its standard form, there is no way to restrict the programs it generates to those where the functions operate on appropriate data types. In the case when the programs manipulate multiple data types and contain functions designed to operate on particular data types, this can lead to unnecessarily large search times and/or unnecessarily poor generalization performance. Strongly typed genetic programming ({STGP}) is an enhanced version of genetic programming that enforces data-type constraints and whose use of generic functions and generic data types makes it more powerful than other approaches to type-constraint enforcement. After describing its operation, we illustrate its use on problems in two domains, matrix/vector manipulation and list manipulation, which require its generality. The examples are (1) the multidimensional least-squares regression problem, (2) the multidimensional Kalman filter, (3) the list manipulation function {NTH}, and (4) the list manipulation function {MAPCAR}.},

    abstract = {This paper describes how fitness inheritance can be used to estimate fitness for a proportion of newly sampled candidate solutions in the Bayesian optimization algorithm ({BOA}). The goal of estimating fitness for some candidate solutions is to reduce the number of fitness evaluations for problems where fitness evaluation is expensive. Bayesian networks used in {BOA} to model promising solutions and generate the new ones are extended to allow not only for modeling and sampling candidate solutions, but also for estimating their fitness. The results indicate that fitness inheritance is a promising concept in {BOA}, because population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models of promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates even if only a small proportion of candidate solutions is evaluated using the actual fitness function. This can lead to a reduction of the number of actual fitness evaluations by a factor of 30 or more.},

The primary focus of the book is on two algorithms that replace traditional variation operators of evolutionary algorithms by learning and sampling Bayesian networks: the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) and the hierarchical BOA (hBOA) . They provide a scalable solution to a broad class of problems. The book provides an overview of evolutionary algorithms that use probabilistic models to guide their search, motivates and describes BOA and hBOA in a way accessible to a wide audience and presents numerous results confirming that they are revolutionary approaches to black-box optimization.},

@article{Peng2010PopAlgPortfolios,
    abstract = {In this paper, we consider the scenario that a population-based algorithm is applied to a numerical optimization problem and a solution needs to be presented within a given time budget. Although a wide range of population-based algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimizers, and differential evolution, have been developed and studied under this scenario, the performance of an algorithm may vary significantly from problem to problem. This implies that there is an inherent risk associated with the selection of algorithms. We propose that, instead of choosing an existing algorithm and investing the entire time budget in it, it would be less risky to distribute the time among multiple different algorithms. A new approach named population-based algorithm portfolio ({PAP}), which takes multiple algorithms as its constituent algorithms, is proposed based upon this idea. {PAP} runs each constituent algorithm with a part of the given time budget and encourages interaction among the constituent algorithms with a migration scheme. As a general framework rather than a specific algorithm, {PAP} is easy to implement and can accommodate any existing population-based search algorithms. In addition, a metric is also proposed to compare the risks of any two algorithms on a problem set. We have comprehensively evaluated {PAP} via investigating 11 instantiations of it on 27 benchmark functions. Empirical results have shown that {PAP} outperforms its constituent algorithms in terms of solution quality, risk, and probability of finding the global optimum. Further analyses have revealed that the advantages of {PAP} are mostly credited to the synergy between constituent algorithms, which should complement each other either over a set of problems, or during different stages of an optimization process.},

However, there is still a noticeable lack of studies on {DE}'s performance on engineering problems, which combine large-size instances, constraint-handling and mixed-integer variables issues. This paper proposes the solution by {DE} of process engineering problems and compares its computational performance with an exact optimization method ({Branch-and-Bound}) and with a Genetic Algorithm. Two analytical formulations are used to model the batch plant design problem and a set of examples gathering the three above-mentioned issues are also provided. The computational results obtained highlight the clear superiority of {DE} since its best found solutions always lie very close to the {Branch-and-Bound} optima. Moreover, for an equal number of objective function evaluations, the results repeatability was found to be much better for the {DE} method than for the Genetic Algorithm.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a competent selectomutative genetic algorithm (GA), that adapts linkage and solves hard problems quickly, reliably, and accurately. A probabilistic model building process is used to automatically identify key building blocks (BBs) of the search problem. The mutation operator uses the probabilistic model of linkage groups to find the best among competing building blocks. The competent selectomutative GA successfully solves additively separable problems of bounded difficulty, requiring only subquadratic number of function evaluations. The results show that for additively separable problems the probabilistic model building BB-wise mutation scales as \${\mathcal{O}}(2^km^{1.5})\$, and requires \${\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{k}\log m)\$ less function evaluations than its selectorecombinative counterpart, confirming theoretical results reported elsewhere [1].},

Facetwise models of convergence time and population sizing have been used to determine the scalability of each algorithm. The analysis shows that for deterministic exponentially-scaled additively separable, problems, the BB-wise mutation is more efficient than crossover yielding a speedup of  o ( l log l ), where  l  is the problem size. For the noisy exponentially-scaled problems, the outcome depends on whether scaling on noise is dominant. When scaling dominates, mutation is more efficient than crossover yielding a speedup of  o ( l log l ).

In order to achieve high expressiveness the trees induced are multivariate, with various, possibly user-defined tests in their internal nodes. Strongly typed genetic programming is utilized to evolve structure of the tests. Special attention is given to the problem of diversity of the forest constructed. An approach is proposed, which explicitly encourages the induction algorithm to produce a different tree each run, which represents an alternative description of the data. It is shown that forests constructed this way have significantly reduced classification error even for small forest size, compared to other ensemble methods. Classification accuracy is also compared to other recent methods on several real-world datasets.},

FEM searches the fitness landscape of an objective function using an instantiation of the well-known Expectation Maximization algorithm, producing search points to match the sample distribution weighted according to higher expected fitness. FEM updates both candidate solution parameters and the search policy, which is represented as a multinormal distribution. Inheriting EM's stability and strong guarantees, the method is both elegant and competitive with some of the best heuristic search methods in the field, and performs well on a number of unimodal and multimodal benchmark tasks. To illustrate the potential practical applications of the approach, we also show experiments on finding the parameters for a controller of the challenging non-Markovian double pole balancing task.},

@ARTICLE{WolpertNFL,
	abstract = {A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving. A number of  no free lunch  (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori  head-to-head  minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms},

	abstract = {Evolution strategies are a class of general optimisation algorithms which are applicable to functions that are multimodal, nondifferentiable, or even discontinuous. Although recombination operators have been introduced into evolution strategies, the primary search operator is still mutation. Classical evolution strategies rely on Gaussian mutations. A new mutation operator based on the Cauchy distribution is proposed in this paper. It is shown empirically that the new evolution strategy based on Cauchy mutation outperforms the classical evolution strategy on most of the 23 benchmark problems tested in this paper. The paper also shows empirically that changing the order of mutating the objective variables and mutating the strategy parameters does not alter the previous conclusion significantly, and that Cauchy mutations with different scaling parameters still outperform the Gaussian mutation with self-adaptation. However, the advantage of Cauchy mutations disappears when recombination is used in evolution strategies. It is argued that the search step size plays an important role in determining evolution strategies' performance. The large step size of recombination plays a similar role as Cauchy mutation.},

Such a process is highly prone to premature convergence. The simplest method for preventing premature convergence of Gaussian distribution is enlarging the maximum likelihood estimate of ? by a constant factor k each generation. Such a factor should be large enough to prevent convergence on slopes of the fitness function, but should not be too large to allow the algorithm converge in the neighborhood of the optimum. Previous work showed that for truncation selection such admissible k exists in 1D case. In this article it is shown experimentaly, that for the Gaussian EDA with truncation selection in high-dimensional spaces no admissible k exists!},

The simplest way of preventing premature convergence by multiplying the variance estimate by a constant factor k each generation is studied. Recent works have shown that when increasing the dimensionality of the search space, such an algorithm becomes very quickly unable to traverse the slope and focus to the optimum at the same time. In this paper it is shown that when isotropic distributions with Gaussian or Cauchy distributed norms are used, the simple constant setting of k is able to ensure a reasonable behaviour of the EDA on the slope and in the valley of the fitness function at the same time.},

    abstract = {In this paper the problem of analysis of eye movements using sinusoidal head rotation test is presented. The goal of the method is to discard automatically the effect of the fast phase-saccades and consequently calculate the response of vestibular system in the form of phase shift and amplitude. The comparison of threshold detection and inductive models trained on saccades is carried out. After saccades detection we are left with discontinuous signal segments. This paper presents an approach to align them to form a smooth signal with the same frequencies that were originally present in the source signal. The approach is based on a direct estimation of the signal component parameters using the evolutionary strategy with covariance matrix adaptation. The performance of evolutionary approach is compared to least-square multimodal sinus fit. The experimental evaluation on real-world signals revealed that threshold saccades detection with combination of the evolutionary strategy is robust, scalable and reliable method.},

Performance is investigated for different dimensions up to 40-D, for different target precision values, and in different subgroups of functions.

    abstract = {The differential evolution ({DE}) algorithm is equipped with the recently proposed adaptive encoding ({AE}) which makes the algorithm rotationally invariant. The resulting algorithm, {DEAE}, should exhibit better performance on non-separable functions. The aim of this article is to assess what benefits the {AE} has, and what effect it has for other function groups. {DEAE} is compared against pure {DE}, an adaptive version of {DE} ({JADE}), and an evolutionary strategy with covariance matrix adaptation ({CMA}-{ES}). The results suggest that {AE} indeed improves the performance of {DE}, particularly on the group of unimodal non-separable functions, but the adaptation of parameters used in {JADE} is more profitable on average. The use of {AE} inside {JADE} is envisioned.},

    abstract = {Four methods for global numerical black box optimization with origins in the mathematical programming community are described and experimentally compared with the state of the art evolutionary method, {BIPOP}-{CMA}-{ES}. The methods chosen for the comparison exhibit various features that are potentially interesting for the evolutionary computation community: systematic sampling of the search space ({DIRECT}, {MCS}) possibly combined with a local search method ({MCS}), or a multi-start approach ({NEWUOA}, {GLOBAL}) possibly equipped with a careful selection of points to run a local optimizer from ({GLOBAL}). The recently proposed ?comparing continuous optimizers? ({COCO}) methodology was adopted as the basis for the comparison. Based on the results, we draw suggestions about which algorithm should be used depending on the available budget of function evaluations, and we propose several possibilities for hybridizing evolutionary algorithms ({EAs}) with features of the other compared algorithms.},

    abstract = {Several local search algorithms for real-valued domains (axis parallel line search, {Nelder-Mead} simplex search, Rosenbrock's algorithm, {quasi-Newton} method, {NEWUOA}, and {VXQR}) are described and thoroughly compared in this article, embedding them in a multi-start method. Their comparison aims (1) to help the researchers from the evolutionary community to choose the right opponent for their algorithm (to choose an opponent that would constitute a hard-to-beat baseline algorithm), (2) to describe individual features of these algorithms and show how they influence the algorithm on different problems, and (3) to provide inspiration for the hybridization of evolutionary algorithms with these local optimizers. The recently proposed Comparing Continuous Optimizers ({COCO}) methodology was adopted as the basis for the comparison. The results show that in low dimensional spaces, the old method of Nelder and Mead is still the most successful among those compared, while in spaces of higher dimensions, it is better to choose an algorithm based on quadratic modeling, such as {NEWUOA} or a {quasi-Newton} method.},

especially relevant in the last decade, with researchers increasingly
investigating how to identify the most suitable existing algorithm for solving a
problem instance instead of developing new algorithms. This survey presents an
overview of this work focusing on the contributions made in the area of
combinatorial search problems, where algorithm selection techniques have
achieved significant performance improvements. We unify and organise the vast
literature according to criteria that determine algorithm selection systems in
practice. The comprehensive classification of approaches identifies and analyses
the different directions from which algorithm selection has been approached.
This paper contrasts and compares different methods for solving the problem as
well as ways of using these solutions.},
