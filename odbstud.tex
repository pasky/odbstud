\title{Systems and Approaches for Question Answering}
\author{Mgr. Petr Baudi≈°}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}%
	I define and explore the task of Factoid Question Answering.
	This involves understanding a naturally phrased question
	about some (often open domain) fact, looking this fact up
	in a knowledge base (structured database or unstructured
	text corpus), and scoring the candidate answers.
	I survey the recent scientific work and directions in this
	field, define some interesting sub-tasks and propose a new dataset.
	I then present my own baseline QA pipeline YodaQA that
	combines both structured and unstructured approaches.
	Based on experiences with this baseline and survey of the
	field, I propose some scientifically promising lines of further
	QA research.
